# arcade-game-clone
This is a clone of the classic arcade game Frogger, completed as a unit project for a Udacity course.

The object of the game is to move your character, appearing here as a super-deformed version of a boy,
from the bottom of the game area to the top. Several enemies in the form of ladybugs will be moving across
the screen and you must avoid them or be returned to the start.

To run the game, open the index.html file in a browser. It will render on pageload, and then you should
control your character with the arrow keys on your keyboard.

Good luck!
